# Machine learning on FIRE

In this project, we use the Ananke and FIRE Milky Way simulations to train a ML algoritm (tbd) 
that uses the kinematics of stars at redshift z=0 to classify types of merger
(i.e. 1:10 merger, 1:100 merger, etc.) and possibly the time of merger.

We apply this algorithm on Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3).
